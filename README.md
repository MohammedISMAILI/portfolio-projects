# From Numbers to Insights: Applying Linear Algebra Techniques to the Boston Housing Dataset

## Description
This project explores the application of linear algebra techniques to predict housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset. The study involves developing a linear regression model enriched with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis to better understand the data structure and enhance model performance. The project demonstrates how matrix operations and vector computations can be leveraged to provide insights into the real estate market.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the model.
- **NumPy**: For matrix operations and numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization, including plots and graphs.
- **Seaborn**: For generating advanced visualizations and heatmaps.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models, including linear regression and PCA.

## Instructions
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   git clone <your-repository-URL>
   Replace <your-repository-URL> with the SSH or HTTPS URL of your GitHub repository.

 2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    cd portfolio-projects/boston-housing-linear-algebra

 3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Make sure you have Python installed (preferably 3.x). Install the necessary Python libraries by running:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   (Note: If you haven't created a requirements.txt file yet, you can install the libraries manually using pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn.)

 4. **Run the Project Script**:
    Execute the Python script to perform the analysis and generate the results:
    python project.py

 5. **View the Results**:

    The script will output various metrics, including the RMSE and R² score.
    Visualizations such as scatter plots and PCA component graphs will be displayed.

 6. **Optional - Modify and Experiment**:

    You can modify the script to experiment with different models or data preprocessing techniques.
    The code is well-commented to help you understand each step of the process.
